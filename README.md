# project-one
Phase: Development.

This project is to connect "Teachers" with "Students" where over skype the teachers can teach a second language to their students.

I am using various packages and want to give credit to their developers, you can find a list of those packages at this link, https://github.com/jkdowdle/project-one/blob/master/.meteor/packages.

I also wanted to give credit to themeteorchef.com for their articale on how to use fullcalendar in meteor. The articale was very helpful in getting the scheduling between teachers and their assigned students. 
That articale is here, https://themeteorchef.com/snippets/reactive-calendars-with-fullcalendar/.
